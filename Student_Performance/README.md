## Context

This project aims to build robust predictive models to anticipate students' academic results based on their behavior (such as study hours and motivation) and their environment (such as parental involvement, internet access, and school type). The goal of these predictions is to help teachers and institutions implement preventive and support strategies to improve student performance.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts students' exam scores based on individual and environmental characteristics. This prediction will allow stakeholders to identify students who might need additional support and provide early interventions.

## Plan

1. **Data Import and Processing**  
   - Importing the dataset and handling any necessary preprocessing such as cleaning, handling missing data, and ensuring all features are in the correct format.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Initial exploration of the data to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between features and the target variable (student exam scores).
   
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Transforming raw data into meaningful input features through techniques such as One-Hot Encoding and Ordinal Encoding for categorical variables, and standardization for numeric variables.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Training various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree) to predict student performance. 
   
5. **Model Testing**  
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE and comparing models based on cross-validation results.

6. **Examples of Predictions**  
   - Illustrating model performance with examples of predictions for new, unseen data.
